[20081104] first cut at 5.0_BETA
================================

Changes:
--------
 - use 200811030002Z daily netbsd-5 snapshot in Makefile
   - now i386 GENERIC kernel recognizes CD-ROM as a booted device so that
     we no longer have to build an i386 server kernel for restorecd
   - MAKEDEV(8) for cobalt creates more device nodes by default
 - pull changes from restorecd-4.0.1-20081017:
   - restorecd now also provides 'rescue' environment which allows remote login
     without a working localdisk, and the conventional restore operation is
     now started via paneld menu invoked by holding off the "select" button
     for two seconds
   - install netbsd-INSTALL.gz kernel as usr/games/.doug in ext2fs partition
     for emergency local boot, which is loaded by holding all four cursor
     buttons on powerup
   - show proper motd(5) login message
   - update instructions.txt and cleanup misc scripts
 - make restorecd also usable for sysinst based install on serial console:
   - fetch and store all cobalt binaries including kern, games, and xsets
   - put netbsd-RAMDISK.gz kernel into nfsroot as /netbsd.sysinst,
     which can be specified on bootloader prompt at the first netboot
 - adjust fstab(5) in installed system:
   - mount a boot ext2fs partition by default
   - add entries for procfs, kernfs and ptyfs to default fstab(5)
 - fix paneld(8) to create a pidfile so that "/etc/rc.d/paneld restart"
   via rc.d(8) works properly
 - fix named(8) settings to use chroot environment so that it won't complain
   "the working directory is not writable"
 - change dhcpd.conf(5) to use ddns-update-style none to avoid warnings
 - also tweak MAKEDEV(8) for cobalt netboot
 - misc updates for restorecd and install-core.sh scripts

[20081008] 4.99.72 -current snapshot update
================================

Changes:
--------
 - use 200801006002Z daily snapshot in Makefile
  - MI mfs unmount bug (PR kern/39307) has been fixed
    so remove a workaround for it
 - bump /var size and use /etc/services from 4.0 release for i386 server
   because stripped version for installation doesn't have telnet lines
   and -current one is too large

[20080912] 4.99.72 -current snapshot
================================

Changes:
--------
 - use 200809100002Z daily snapshot in Makefile
 - update misc scripts for recent -current:
  for cobalt installation:
   - include paneld(8) sources and patches and fix one warning
   - enable wapbl(4) (ffs journaling) in fstab(5)
   - use raw devices for newfs(8)
   - don't run rc.d/sysdb
   - use default GENERIC kernel
   - use default fdisk(8) binary
   - use default newfs_ext2fs(8) binary
   - use default bootloader (which prints boot messages to LCD)
  for i386 server:
   - ignore fwip(4) interface
   - don't start postfix(8)
   - prepare stripped etc/services to avoid /var overflow

[20080511] Script improvements for easy build
================================

Improvements:
-------------
(Note no changes in cobalt binaries to be installed)

 - prepare dumb Makefile to build restorecd.iso
   (you still need wget or rsync to get release files)
 - use makefs(8) which is built from NetBSD toolchain
   rather than optional mkisofs(8)
 - use GENERIC like kernel for i386 server with
   no-emul-boot support on creating bootable CD image
 - let init(8) create device nodes on netboot cobalt
   and remove all device nodes from restorecd image
   so that su(1) root is no longer needed to create image
 - add a workaround for a permission problem on
   altvar/spool/ftp/hidden

[20080312] Updates for network hang problem
================================

Fixes:
------
