# This file is (nearly) the last thing invoked by /etc/rc during a
# normal boot, via /etc/rc.d/local.
#
# It is intended to be edited locally to add site-specific boot-time
# actions, such as starting locally installed daemons.
#
# An alternative option is to create site-specific /etc/rc.d scripts.

# Add your local daemons here.
